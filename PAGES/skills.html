      <p>To be really honest, there's only an ordinary number of things I could do, but not significant enough to call them as skills; in which I am conflicted if I could consider them as one.<sup>1</sup> But for the sake of indulging you, dear reader, I will jog my brain and pick up whatever's on the back of my mind.<sup>2</sup> <b>My first love was reading.</b><sup>3</sup> I spent a significant amount of my elementary years in school cooped up in the library.<sup>4</sup> I read a lot of fiction books and I certainly believe that it kickstarted my vivid imagination.<sup>5</sup> There's also the fact that I can read over a hundred words per minute, which isn't that cool, but I'm kind of proud of it.<sup>6</sup> Moving on, <b>I’m a pretty crafty person</b>, and could make anything as long as I put my mind into it, and how much my creative capabilities would let me.<sup>7</sup> And with that, I’ve developed a skill for media computing, such as <b>video editing</b>.<sup>8</sup> This artistic vision is something I’ve always take pride on.<sup>9</sup> Do not get me wrong, though.<sup>10</sup> I have no skills for art techniques like drawing or any formal artistic creation.<sup>11</sup> So, I thought, <b>“Why not just take whatever I have and make something with it?”</b>.<sup>12</sup> See, that’s the beauty of art.<sup>13</sup> <b>No rules, just vibes.</b><sup>14</sup> The sky’s the limit – literally.<sup>15</sup> Not just artistic media, <b>there’s also writing</b>, where I found my safe haven to express my thoughts if I do not have the opportunity to translate it into something more concrete.<sup>16</sup> On a more personal note, <b>I am an empathetic person</b>, with a good attention to detail about people.<sup>17</sup> I value my connections with people, so I try to be considerate for them.<sup>18</sup> This empathy, combined with my observant nature, allows me to understand and appreciate diverse perspectives.<sup>19</sup> I am confident with my ability to learn and adapt, making the most of my resources and talents I have.<sup>20</sup> So, maybe I don’t have a list of impressive “skills”, but I’m resourceful, compassionate, and always eager to learn.<sup>21</sup> <b>That has to count for something</b>.<sup>22</sup>

        <p>While the term “skill” feels a bit formal for the things I enjoy, I do have a collection of hobbies that keep me busy and, more importantly, happy.<sup>1</sup>  Much like my approach to art, <b>I’m ready to take on anything with an open mind and a willingness to experiment</b>.<sup>2</sup>  Video editing, for instance, allows me to combine my love for storytelling with a bit of technical know-how, <b>turning simple clips into something a little more engaging</b>.<sup>3</sup>  Of course, <b>reading remains a constant companion</b>, a way to escape into different worlds and fuel my imagination.<sup>4</sup>  I love a good fiction book, especially with genres like fantasy, a little bit of romance, and interesting worldbuilding lore.<sup>5</sup> Then there's <b>crocheting</b>, a surprisingly therapeutic activity that lets me create tangible things, from cozy blankets to quirky little amigurumi.<sup>6</sup> Creating something out of my own hands brings a unique sense of satisfaction.<sup>7</sup> Like, hey, I just made this little guy!<sup>8</sup> How cool is that?<Sup>9</Sup> It's a nice balance to the more digital aspects of my life.<Sup>10</Sup>  <b>Recently, I found makeup to be another creative outlet</b>, a chance to play with colors, or sometimes just try out a new technique I saw online.<sup>11</sup> I do believe that my life is a canvas, and my face is not an exception.<sup>12</sup> And when I need to escape the everyday, <b>I immerse myself in the captivating world of movies and series</b>.<sup>13</sup> Who could forget the simple pleasure of getting lost in a good movie?<sup>14</sup> It's the perfect way to unwind and recharge.<sup>15</sup> From gripping dramas to lighthearted comedies, I find solace and entertainment in the stories unfolding on screen.<sup>16</sup> The best part is, <b>I'm always on the lookout for something new to try</b>.<Sup>17</Sup>  Whether it's learning a new craft, exploring a different genre of film, or picking up a new book, I love the feeling of discovering something that sparks my interest.<sup>18</sup>  <b>There's always something exciting waiting to be explored</b>.<sup>19</sup> This constant quest for novelty keeps life entertaining and prevents me from falling into a rut.<sup>20</sup> So, I embrace my thirst for discovery, and continue to explore the vast landscape of hobbies, always eager to find my next passion that will capture my heart.<sup>21</sup> <b>After all, life is too short to be bored</b>.<sup>22</sup>
